CairoGraph is a small library I developed to make 2D graphs in gtkmm applications.\
It is used in my TCalc project, this is a small demo of what can de done with\
gtkmm and cairomm. It helps if you have Nimbus Roman fonts installed.

This a gnome builder project or vscode. 
Simply clone the repo and load the project in gnome-builder

https://github.com/AlexB67/CairoPlot.git

The project is build with CairoPLot as a meson subproject.

flatpak builds work in gnome-builder as well.
