CairoGraph is a small library I developed to make 2D graphs in gtkmm applications.\
It is used in my TCalc project, this is a small demo of what can de done with\
gtkmm and cairomm.

This a gnomw builder poject. Simply clone the repo and load the project in gnome-builder
flatpak builds work as well.
